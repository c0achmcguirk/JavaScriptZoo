=============

A VS 2012 Project for comparing CoffeeScript and TypeScript.

Purpose
-------
This project was created to compare [CoffeeScript](http://www.coffeescript.org) and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) in a Visual Studio 2012 solution. There are several branches in this git project, each branch compares a different feature of the languages.

- [ASP.NET and Web Tools 2012.2 Update](http://www.asp.net/vnext). Needed for CoffeeScript support in your IDE and also has some new bangin' features for web tooling in your IDE.
- [Install TypeScript](http://typescript.codeplex.com/). Follow the instructions here to get TypeScript installed into VS 2012.
- [Solve TypeScript Install Issue](http://bit.ly/QGb6q5). If TypeScript doesn't work in Visual Studio yet, follow the instructions here.
- [VS 2012 Web Essentials Extension](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ed4c78f-a23e-49ad-b5fd-369af0c2107f) This extension gives you the split screen effect and can compile and minimize your TypeScript/CoffeeScript.
- [CodeSchool CoffeeScript Test](http://coffeescript.codeschool.com/). A Sip of CoffeeScript. Take the free test (module 1) to see how well you can do.

Branches
--------
The following branches exist in this project. Here are brief descriptiosn of each.

- **01-Assignment** Shows how you assign values to variables in both languages.
- **02-Conditions** If/Else blocks
- **03-Whitespace** CoffeeScript is sensitive to whitespace, TypeScript is not.
- **04-StronglyTyped** See how TypeScript strongly types variables, CoffeeScript is like JavaScript--it doesn't care.
- **05-Functions** CoffeeScript has a unique function syntax. TypeScript is a little more familiar.
- **06-DefaultParameters** Both CoffeeScript and TypeScript permit you to have default parameter values.
- **07-Arrays** See how CoffeeScript and TypeScript handle arrays.
- **08-Classes** You can't look at TypeScript or CoffeeScript and ignore classes. See how they work.
- **08-Splats** Do you find yourself needing to handle a variable number of parameters? Splats to the rescue.
- **09-Intellisense** This branch shows how TypeScript helps you find errors that would be missed by CoffeeScript.
- **10-Interfaces** JavaScript and CoffeeScript do not have them, but TypeScript does.
- **15-ExistenceOperator** CoffeeScript gives you some nice operators to make for readable code.
- **16-Comprehensions** One of CoffeeScripts greatest strengths.
- **17-Hoisting** CoffeeScript properly "hoists" the varaible declaration to the top of the function block. TypeScript doesn't.
- **18-SkinnyAndFatArrows** _this_ can cause problems. See how CoffeeScript can handle it compared to TypeScript.
